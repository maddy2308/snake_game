# snake_game

This was a final course project for Introduction to Android at Senecca (York Campus). Snake game is a classic mobile based game where a snake can eat food and move in 4 directions from (left, right, up and down) unless it's head collides with it's tail or it collides with the edge of the screen.

Enjoy the game and file a bug if you find one. Hopefully you enjoy the game.
